problem: Let $ABCD$ be a rectangle such that $AB = 4$ and $BC = 3$. Construct a circle that is tangent to the lines $\overline{BC}, \overline{BD}$, and $\overline{AD}$, and let $O$ be the center of this circle. Find the area of triangle $ABO$.

      Note: The problem, as stated, had two answers; it was incorrectly stated. Both answers were accepted.
      
      We let $O$ be closer to $CD$ for now. Let the circle's tangency point on $\overline{AD}$ be $X$, the tangency point on $\overline{BD}$ be $Y$, and the tangency point on $\overline{BC}$ be $Z$. Note $O$ is the midpoint of $XZ$ as $AX\parallel BZ$. Also, $DX=CZ$. Note by Two Tangent $DX=DY$ and $BZ=BY$ so $2DX+3=DX+BZ=DY+BY=BD=5$, implying $DX=1$. Thus the distance from $O$ to $CD$ is $1$ and thus the distance from $O$ to $AB$ is $3+1=4$, so the area is $\frac{4\cdot 4}{2}=8$.

      If $O$ was closer to $AB$ then its distance from $AB$ would just be $1$ and the answer would be $\frac{4\cdot 1}{2}=2$.
