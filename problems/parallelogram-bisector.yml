problem: Consider parallelogram $ABCD$ with $AB=10$ and $BC=11$. Let the angle bisector of $\angle DAB$ intersect $BC$ at $P$ and $CD$ at $Q$. If the lines through $P$ and $Q$ parallel to $BD$ intersect line $AB$ at points $X$ and $Y$, what is the length of segment $XY$? Express your answer as a common fraction.

      This problem is somewhat tricky because there's a lot going on, so we state the important pairs of similar triangles upfront.

      Note that
      \begin{align*}
        \triangle XBP & \sim \triangle BAD,             \\
        \triangle ABP & \sim \triangle ADQ, \text{ and} \\
        \triangle XAP & \sim \triangle YAQ.
      \end{align*}
      By the first pair of similar triangles, $XB=AB\cdot\frac{10}{11}=\frac{100}{11}$. The second pair of similar triangles gives us $AP=10PQ$, and the third pair of similar triangles gives us $\frac{AY}{AX}=\frac{AQ}{AP}=\frac{11}{10}$. Thus
      \[XY=AY-AX=\frac{11}{10}AX-AX=\frac{1}{10}AX = \frac{1}{10}(10+\frac{100}{11})=\frac{21}{10}.\]
