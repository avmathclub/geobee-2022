problem: |-
  Anthony the ant is on a vertex $A$ of the cube with side length $1$ inch. $B$ is another vertex on the cube such that $B$ is $1$ inch away from $A$. He can only walk on the surface of the cube. Let the edge of the cube furthest away from $AB$ be colored red. Anthony wants to go to $B$ from $A$ but he must touch the red edge first. What is the smallest distance (in inches) that Anthony must travel to complete this journey?

  - text: It will be much easier to do this problem if we could turn it into two dimensions. For convenience, we refer to the edge furthest from $AB$ as $CD$. Imagine $CD$ and $AB$ on the same flat plane, achieved by flattening about one of the edges parallel to $AB$ and $CD$. We can simplify this problem by considering two $1\times 1$ squares that share an edge. We label the bottom right vertex to be $A$, the bottom left vertex to be $B$, and color the top edge of the top square red. The smallest distance it takes for Anthony to go from $A$ to the red line to $B$ can be calculated by reflecting our two squares over the red line we made. We label $B'$ to be the reflection of $B$ across this red line. We see that any path from $A$ to the red line to $B$ can be reflected over the red line to create a path from $A$ to $B'$. Therefore, the smallest distance from $A$ to the red line to $B$ is the same as calculating the smallest distance from $A$ to $B'$. The smallest distance between $A$ to $B'$ is just a line. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have our answer $$d = \sqrt{1^2 + 4^2}$$ $$d^2 = \sqrt{17}.$$
