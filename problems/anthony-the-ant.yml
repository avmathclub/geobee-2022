problem: |-
  Anthony the ant is on a vertex $A$ of the cube with side length $1$ inch. $B$ is another vertex on the cube such that $B$ is $1$ inch away from $A$. He can only walk on the surface of the cube. Let the edge of the cube furthest away from $AB$ be colored red. Anthony wants to go to $B$ from $A$ but he must touch the red edge first. If the smallest distance (in inches) that Anthony must travel to complete this journey is $d$, find $d^2$.

      Let $A=(0,0,0)$ and $B=(1,0,0)$, and let the vertices of the red edge be $(0,1,1)$ and $(1,1,1)$.\footnote{This is enough to uniquely determine the rest of the vertices of the cube.} We describe the coordinates of the best path Anthony could take.

      He goes from $(0,0,0)$ to $(0,\frac{2}{3},1)$ to $(\frac{1}{2},1,1)$ to $(1,\frac{2}{3},0)$ then to $(1,0,0)$. The distance in this path is $\sqrt{13}$, so our answer is $13$.
