problem: Consider equilateral $\triangle ABC$ with side length $4$, incircle $\omega$, and incenter $I$. Let $\ell_1$ be the line through $I$ parallel to $BC$ and $\ell_2$ be the line that is not $BC$ that is tangent to $\omega$ and parallel to $BC$. If the area of the quadrilateral bound by lines $AB$, $AC$, $\ell_1$, and $\ell_2$ can be expressed as $\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p}$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $p$ and squarefree $n$, find $m+n+p$.

  - text: Dropping an altitude from one of the vertices, we see that the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $2 \cdot 2\sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3}$. We use $A = \frac{P \cdot r}{2}$ to get that the inradius of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$. We can obtain the area of the quadrilateral defined by the lines $\overline{AB}, \overline{AC}, L_1, L_2$ by finding the area of the triangle defined by $\overline{AB}, \overline{AC}$, and $L_1$ and subtracting the area of the triangle defined by $\overline{AB}, \overline{AC}$, and $L_2$. The three triangles created by $L_1$ and $L_2$ are all equilateral and thus are all similar. Knowing that the value of the inradius is $\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$ and that the altitude from $A$ to $\overline{BC}$ has length $2\sqrt{3}$, we can find that the height of the triangle with base $L_2$ is $\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}$ and the height of the triangle with base $L_1$ is $\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$. By similarity, the area of the triangle with base $L_2$ has area $\frac{2}{3}^2 = \frac{4}{9}$ of the area of $\triangle ABC$ and the area of the triangle with base $L_1$ has area $\frac{1}{3}^2 = \frac{1}{9}$ of the area of $\triangle ABC$. The quadrilateral defined by the lines $\overline{AB}, \overline{AC}, L_1,$ and $L_2$ then must have area $\frac{4}{9} - \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$ of the area of $\triangle ABC$. Thus the area is $\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}$, yielding an answer of $10$.

  - text: Let $\ell_1$ intersect $AB$ and $AC$ at $P$ and $Q$, and let $\ell_2$ intersect $AB$ and $AC$ at $X$ and $Y$. We can then find $[APQ]-[AXY]$. It's known that the center of an equilateral triangle is $\frac{2}{3}$ the way down the altitude, so $[APQ]=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2[ABC]$. Since the radius is $\frac{1}{3}$ the height from $A$ to $BC$, the diameter is $\frac{2}{3}$, and thus $[AXY]=\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2[ABC]$. Thus $[APQ]-[AXY]=\frac{1}{3}[ABC]$ and as $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, $[ABC]=4\sqrt{3}$. Thus the area is $\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}$, yielding an answer of $10$.
