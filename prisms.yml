problem: We have an infinite number of rectangular prisms that are $2$ inches wide, $4$ inches long, and $6$ inches tall. What is the maximum number of such rectangular prisms that we can fit into a cube with a length of $1$ foot?

  - text: Drawing the rectangular prism and cube can help you visualize the problem. First, we want to convert all of our measurements to the same unit. A cube with a length of 1 foot is the same as considering a cube with dimensions: $12$ inches by $12$ inches by $12$ inches. We simply use division to find how many rectangular prisms we can fit by length, width, and height in the cube. $\frac{12}{6}$ is $2$, so we can stack at most $2$ rectangular prisms on top of each other so that their combined height does not exceed the height of the box. $\frac{12}{4}$ is $3$, so we can stack at most $3$ rectangular prisms length-wise so that their combined length does not exceed that of the box. $\frac{12}{2}$ is $6$, so we can stack at most $6$ rectangular prisms width-wise so that their combined width does not exceed the width of the box. We can see that it will be possible to create a "block" that is $2$ rectangular prisms tall, $3$ rectangular prisms long, and $6$ rectangular prisms wide. Thus, the maximum number of rectangular prisms we can fit into the cube is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 6 = 36$. We know that this is the correct answer because such an arrangement of rectangular prisms will leave no unfilled space in the box.
