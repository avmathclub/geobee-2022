problem: Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle such that $\angle A = 60^{\circ}$, $\angle B = 75^{\circ}$, and $\angle C = 45^{\circ}$ such that the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ has circumference 16. Let $l$ be the locus of all points $P$ such that $P$ is in the interior of $\triangle ABC$ and $\angle ABP + \angle ACP = 60{\circ}$. What is the length of $l$?

      $ABPC$ is a quadrilateral, so its angles must add up to $360^{\circ}$. From information given in the problem statement it follows that in quadrilateral $ABPC$, $\angle BPC = 240^{\circ}$. $\angle BPC$ of triangle $\triangle BPC$ must then be $120^{\circ}$. Because this is the only condition $P$ must satisfy, we see that the locus of possible $P$ is restricted to points in $\triangle ABC$ with $\angle BPC$ of $\triangle BPC$ equal to $120^{\circ}$. Now, notice that any possible $P$ can be reflected across side $\overline{BC}$ to a point $P'$ and we will have $\angle BP'C = 120^{\circ}$. We also know that $\angle A = 60^{\circ}$, so because $\angle BP'C + \angle A = 180^{\circ}$, $ABP'C$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. If we draw the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$, $P'$ will have to lie on this circumcircle on the opposite side of point $A$. Since the minor arc $\stackrel \frown {BC}$ encompasses possible points for $\angle P' = 120^{\circ}$ and $P$ is a reflection of $P'$ across $\overline{BC}$, it follows that $l$ is a curve that lies on a circle with the same radius as the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$.

      The minor arc $\stackrel \frown {BC} = 120^{\circ}$ but if this arc is reflected over $\overline{BC}$, part of the arc may lie outside of the triangle. Let the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$ be the point $O$. Reflect the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ over $\overline{BC}$, and let the center of this new circle be $O'$. Let $X$ be the intersection of this circle at $O'$ with $\overline{AB}$ such that $X \neq B$, and let $Y$ be the intersection of the circle at $O'$ with $\overline{AC}$ such that $Y \neq C$. $$\angle BOC = 2 \cdot \angle A = 120^{\circ}$$ Because $O'$ is $O$ reflected over $BC$, $\angle BO'C = 120^{\circ}$ as well. This means that $O'$ lies on the minor arc $\stackrel \frown {BC}$. $O'$ is also equidistant from $B$ and $C$ as the circle at $O'$ passes through $B$ and $C$. $\triangle BO'C$ is thus isosceles and $$\angle O'BC = \angle O'CB = 30^{\circ}$$ $$\angle ABO' = \angle ABC + \angle CBO' = 75^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} = 105^{\circ}$$ Because $\triangle O'BX$ is isosceles ($B$ and $X$ both lie on the circle centered at $O'$), we see that $X$ must be on the opposite side of $B$ as point $A$. $$\angle ACO' = \angle ACB + \angle BCO' = 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} = 75^{\circ}$$ Because $\triangle O'CY$ is isosceles ($C$ and $Y$ both lie on the circle centered at $O'$), we see that $Y$ must be on the same side of $C$ as point $A$. $B$ must be the first intersection of $\overline{AB}$ with the circle centered at $O'$ and $C$ must be the second intersection of $\overline{AC}$ with this circle. Therefore, $l$ is the minor arc $\stackrel \frown {BY}$. $$\angle YO'C = 180^{\circ} - 2 \cdot 75^{\circ} = 30^{\circ}$$ $$\stackrel \frown {BY} = 120^{\circ} - 30^{\circ} = 90^{\circ}$$ $\stackrel \frown {BY}$ has length $\frac{1}{4}$ of the circumference of the circle at $O'$, meaning that $l$ has length $$\frac{16}{4} = \ansbold{4}.$$
